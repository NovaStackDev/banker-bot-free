# Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Strategy
# -------------------------------------------
# Executes a target order in equal-sized portions at fixed time intervals.
# Designed to minimize market impact and achieve a price near the 
# time-weighted average over the execution window.
#
# This method does not involve speculative forecasting or market manipulation.
# Embedded risk controls include:
#  - Maximum position limits (to cap total exposure)
#  - Maximum order notional limits (per transaction size constraint)
#  - Slippage protection (ensures execution remains within price tolerance)
#
# Fully compliant with regulatory best practices for transparent,
# risk-managed trade execution.
